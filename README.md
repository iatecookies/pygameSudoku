# Survival of the Fishest
```
A 2D survival game. You start as a small fish swimming about in an infinitely big world. 
Eating food and other fish allows you to grow and eat larger food.
Be careful, though! If you eat any dangerous objects such as plastic, you will die.
You also need to avoid any natural enemies such as predators and poisonous animals and plants.
It's an educational game in which you learn what the fish eats and what its natural enemies are.
The game also raises the player's environmental awareness.
